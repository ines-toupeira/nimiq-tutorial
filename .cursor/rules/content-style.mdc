# Principles for Writing Tutorial Content

- Structure lessons as clear, incremental steps; each step should build on the previous and lead to a tangible outcome.
- Use concise, jargon-free language; explain technical terms with analogies or real-world context.
- Always provide actionable instructions and immediate feedback (e.g., console output, result screenshots).
- Emphasize safety, experimentation, and learning by using testnets and warning about real-world risks.
- Summarize what was achieved at the end of each lesson and preview the next step.
- Use bullet points, headings, and code blocks for clarity.
- Avoid unnecessary repetition; keep content focused and relevant to the current learning objective.
- When referencing code, explain what each part does and why it matters.
- Encourage curiosity and experimentation; highlight what learners can try on their own.

# Example

> "Let's check your wallet balance:
>
> ```js
> const account = await client.getAccount(address.toUserFriendlyAddress())
> console.log('ðŸ’° Balance:', account.balance / 1e5, 'NIM')
> ```
>
> This code queries the blockchain for your account's balance. You should see the testnet NIM you received from the faucet!"
