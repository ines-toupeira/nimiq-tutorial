# Understanding Staking in Nimiq

## Overview

- **Staking** is the process of locking up NIM tokens to participate in network validation and earn rewards
- **Validators** are network participants who validate transactions and create new blocks
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** allows token holders to delegate their stake to validators
- **Rewards** are distributed to validators and their delegators based on their stake and performance

## Learning

Nimiq uses a **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)** consensus mechanism where validators are responsible for:

- **Validating transactions** and ensuring they follow network rules
- **Creating new blocks** and adding them to the blockchain
- **Maintaining network security** through their stake commitment

### Key Staking Concepts

**Validators:**
- Network nodes that stake a minimum amount of NIM (typically 100,000 NIM)
- Responsible for block production and transaction validation
- Earn rewards based on their performance and total stake

**Delegators:**
- NIM holders who delegate their tokens to validators
- Don't need to run validator infrastructure
- Share in validator rewards proportional to their delegation

**Staking Rewards:**
- Validators and delegators earn NIM rewards for securing the network
- Rewards are distributed automatically each epoch
- Higher stake generally means higher rewards (but also higher risk)

**Slashing:**
- Validators can lose staked funds for malicious behavior
- Delegators share in validator penalties
- This mechanism ensures validators act honestly

## Staking Benefits

1. **Earn Passive Income:** Receive regular NIM rewards
2. **Network Security:** Help secure the Nimiq blockchain
3. **Governance Participation:** Validators can participate in network governance
4. **Low Barriers:** Delegators can start with any amount of NIM

## Getting Started

In this tutorial series, we'll learn how to:

1. **Understand staking concepts** (this lesson)
2. **Query validator information** from the network
3. **Create staking transactions** to delegate NIM
4. **Monitor rewards and performance** of your delegated stake

Let's start by exploring the current validator landscape on the Nimiq network!
