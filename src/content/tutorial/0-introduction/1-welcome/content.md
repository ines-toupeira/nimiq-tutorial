# Welcome to Nimiq Web Tutorial! üöÄ

**Nimiq** is a browser-native blockchain that lets you build decentralized applications without complex setup. No downloads, no installations - just JavaScript that connects directly to the blockchain!

## What Makes This Tutorial Special?

- **Zero setup required** - Everything runs in your browser
- **Real blockchain interaction** - Connect to the actual Nimiq network
- **Hands-on learning** - Try code examples immediately
- **Beginner-friendly** - No prior blockchain experience needed

## What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll know how to:

‚úÖ **Connect to the Nimiq network** and read blockchain data  
‚úÖ **Create wallets** and send transactions  
‚úÖ **Work with staking** to earn rewards  
‚úÖ **Create cashlinks** for shareable payments  
‚úÖ **Build real applications** that users can interact with

## Tutorial Overview

**Part 1: Connecting to the Network**
Learn how to connect to Nimiq and explore the blockchain

**Part 2: Working with Transactions**
Create wallets, request test funds, and send your first transaction

**Part 3: Staking and Validators**
Understand Proof-of-Stake and earn rewards by delegating

**Part 4: HTLC and Cashlinks**
Create shareable payment links using Hash Time Locked Contracts

## Let's Get Started!

First, let's install the tutorial dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then try your first example:

```bash
npm run basics
```

This will connect to the Nimiq network and show you live blockchain data!

#### Other Examples You Can Try

Once you're comfortable, explore these other examples:

- `npm run transactions` - Send payments and manage wallets
- `npm run staking` - Delegate tokens and earn rewards
- `npm run htlc` - Create shareable payment links (cashlinks)

## What You Need to Know

**JavaScript Basics**: You should be comfortable with:
- Variables and functions
- `async/await` (we'll guide you through this)
- Basic object manipulation

**New to Blockchain?** No problem! We'll explain everything as we go.

## About This Environment

This tutorial runs in your browser using **WebContainer** - a real Node.js environment that needs no setup. You get:

- A working terminal (try it below!)
- A complete file system
- All the tools you need to build with Nimiq

The code you write here works in any JavaScript environment: browsers, Node.js, or modern runtimes like Deno and Bun.
