# You Did It! 🎉

Congratulations! You've just accomplished something pretty amazing - you built your first blockchain application and connected directly to a global network!

## What You Actually Built

Look at what you created with just a few lines of JavaScript:

✅ **A Real Blockchain Connection** - Your app talks directly to the Nimiq network  
✅ **Live Data Access** - You're reading real-time blockchain information  
✅ **Global Network Participation** - You joined thousands of nodes worldwide  
✅ **Zero Trust Required** - No third parties, no APIs, direct blockchain access

Your `index.js` file is now a fully functional blockchain application! 🌟

## The Magic You Just Performed

Think about what you achieved:

- **Connected to a global network** of computers maintaining a shared ledger
- **Established cryptographic consensus** without trusting anyone
- **Read live blockchain data** from anywhere in the world
- **Did it all in a browser** with pure JavaScript

This is the future of decentralized applications, and you just built one! 

## You're Ready for More!

Now that you can connect to Nimiq, you're ready to build even more powerful applications:

💰 **Working with Transactions** 💰  
Learn to create wallets, request test funds, and send your first blockchain transaction

🏛️ **Staking and Validators** 🏛️  
Discover how to earn rewards by participating in Nimiq's Proof-of-Stake consensus

🔗 **HTLC and Cashlinks** 🔗  
Create shareable payment links that anyone can claim

## Next Steps
